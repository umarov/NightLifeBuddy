NightLife Buddy by Muzafar, Alfredo and Jason.

NightLife Buddy is a Web App to find a place to go out. This was a semester project for Agile Rapid Development class.
Currently users can only search by Venue Name, Event Name, and Genre Name. This is local to Washington, DC area. 
We use Typeahead.js for our search autocomplete functionality.
Each suggestion you get will take you to the profile of that entity, except genres. Clicking on Genres will take you to the events that are in that genre.
If there is only one event in that specific genre, then you wil be directly taken to that event.


The actual app runs on Google App Engine. You can check it out here http://nightlifebuddy.appspot.com

What we use: Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JSON, Google App Engine Datastore.

So far we went through three iterations. Now that the semester is over Muzafar will be working on this application.

Enjoy!
