NightLife Buddy by Muzafar, Alfredo and Jason.

NightLife Buddy is a Web App to find a place to go out. 
Currently users can only search by Venue Name, Event Name, and Genre Name. This is local to Washington, DC area. 
We use <a href="https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/blob/master/doc/jquery_typeahead.md">Typeahead.js</a> for our search autocomplete functionality.
Each suggestion you get will take you to the profile of that entity, except genres. Clicking on Genres will take you to the events that are in that genre.
If there is only one event in that specific genre, then you wil be directly taken to that event.


The actual app runs on Google App Engine. You can check it out <a href="http://nightlifebuddy.appspot.com">HERE</a>

Enjoy!
